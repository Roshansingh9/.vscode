# DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

Welcome to the **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** repository! This repository contains the initial code I have started writing while beginning my journey in learning and practicing DSA concepts. It serves as a personal archive and reference for my progress.

## Repository Structure

The repository will eventually include code for:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Recursion and Backtracking**

## Purpose

This repository is for personal use and learning. As a beginner, the code stored here represents my starting steps and gradual understanding of DSA concepts. It may not include detailed explanations or optimized solutions but reflects my progress and dedication to mastering the subject.

## How to Access

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Roshansingh9/DSA.git
   ```
2. Browse through the directories to find the code for specific topics.
